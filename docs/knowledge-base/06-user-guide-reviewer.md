### Structured Assessment Framework

Evaluate every project on these dimensions:

| 1 | No clear benefit to ecosystem |

**Questions to Consider:**
- Does this solve a real problem for Cardano users?

|-------|---------|
| 5 | All progress easily verifiable |
| 4 | Most deliverables can be verified |
| 3 | Some deliverables verifiable |
| 2 | Difficult to verify progress |

- Can the community track progress?

#### 4. Value for Money (1-5)

## Reviewer Ethics

### Conflict of Interest

You must NOT review projects where you have:
- Financial interest (investor, token holder)
- Personal relationship with team
- Competing project
- Previous professional involvement

If unsure, disclose the potential conflict in your review.

### Objectivity

- Base all assessments on observable evidence
- Separate personal preferences from objective analysis
- Give benefit of the doubt when evidence is ambiguous
- Update reviews when new information emerges

### Consistency

- Apply same standards across all projects
- Don't hold newer proposers to different standards
- Review your past reviews periodically for bias

## Common Scenarios

### Project Has No Track Record

- Focus on feasibility and auditability
- Note the unproven status objectively
- Don't penalize new proposers unfairly
- Look for transferable experience

### Project Similar to Past Failures

- Compare objectively to past projects
- Note what's different in approach
- Assess if lessons were learned
- Be fair—similarity isn't guaranteed failure

### Project in Unfamiliar Category

- Only review in your areas of competence
- If reviewing outside expertise, note limitations
- Seek input from other reviewers
- Focus on universal criteria (team, budget, clarity)

### Pressure from Project Team

If contacted by project team:
- Don't modify review based on lobbying
- Report harassment to moderators
- Keep all communications professional
- Document inappropriate contact
