## Submitting Concerns

### What Is a Concern?

A concern is a structured way to flag specific issues with a project. Unlike reviews (which are general assessments), concerns are focused on particular problems.

### When to Submit a Concern

- You've identified a specific issue that others should know about
- You have evidence to support your concern
- The issue is factual, not just a matter of opinion

### Concern Categories

| Category | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| **Delayed Delivery** | Milestones are significantly behind schedule |
| **Communication Issues** | Team is unresponsive to community |
| **Quality Issues** | Deliverables don't meet expectations |
| **Misrepresentation** | Proposal claims don't match reality |
| **Other** | Issues that don't fit above categories |

### How to Submit

1. Navigate to project detail page
2. Find **Concerns** section
3. Click **Report Concern**
4. Fill out the form:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Category** | Yes | Select from dropdown |
| **Description** | Yes | Detailed explanation |
| **Evidence URL** | No | Link to supporting evidence |

5. Click **Submit**
6. Your concern becomes visible on the project page

### What Happens Next

1. **Project team notified**: They can respond directly
2. **Public visibility**: Other users can see the concern
3. **Team response**: Project leaders can explain or address
4. **Resolution**: Concerns can be marked resolved
5. **Reputation impact**: Valid concerns increase your reputation
