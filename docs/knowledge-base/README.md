## About PROOF

### Mission

Make Cardano treasury funding outcomes legible, comparable, and socially accountable.

### The Problem We Solve

Cardano's Project Catalyst has distributed $100M+ to 2,000+ projects with no unified way to:
- Track who delivered what
- Identify concerning patterns
- Recognize successful builders
- Make informed voting decisions

### Our Solution

PROOF provides:
- **Transparency**: Every funded project tracked with full history
- **Accountability**: Proposer scores based on delivery history
- **Discoverability**: Search, filter, and visualize the funding network
- **Community Intelligence**: Reviews, concerns, and flags

### Core Principles

1. **Fact-first**: Claims must be source-linked
2. **Neutral language**: Metrics speak for themselves
3. **Source provenance**: Every field tracks its origin
4. **No doxxing**: Only public data
5. **Confidence transparency**: Scores show their reliability
6. **Immutable audit trail**: All actions logged
