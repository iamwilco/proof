### Response Best Practices

**Example Good Response:**
```
Thank you for raising this. You're correct that Milestone 2 
was delivered 3 weeks late. This was due to unexpected smart 
contract audit findings that required additional development.

We've updated our timeline and Milestone 3 is now on track 
for completion by [date]. See our latest progress report for details.
```

**Example Poor Response:**
```
This isn't fair. We're working hard and you don't understand 
how difficult this is.
```

### Concern Resolution

If the concern is addressed:
1. The person who raised it can mark it resolved
2. Moderators can also close concerns
3. Resolved concerns show as "Addressed" with response

## Building Your Accountability Score

### How It's Calculated

Your score (0-100) combines:

| Component | Weight | How to Improve |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Completion** | 30% | Complete more projects you start |
| **Delivery** | 25% | Hit milestone deadlines |
| **Community** | 20% | Get positive reviews |
| **Efficiency** | 15% | Deliver value relative to funding |
| **Communication** | 10% | Submit reports, respond to concerns |

### Badge Progression

| Badge | Score | What It Signals |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 🟢 **TRUSTED** | 80-100 | Voters should have high confidence |
| 🔵 **RELIABLE** | 60-79 | Generally delivers, minor issues |
| 🟡 **UNPROVEN** | 40-59 | Limited track record |
| 🔴 **CONCERNING** | 0-39 | History of non-delivery |

### Improving Your Score

1. **Complete milestones on time**: Single biggest factor
2. **Submit monthly reports**: Shows active communication
3. **Respond to concerns**: Demonstrates engagement
4. **Deliver quality**: Better reviews = higher score
5. **Finish projects**: Completion rate matters most

### Score Disputes

1. Navigate to your profile
2. Click **Dispute Score**
3. Provide evidence of incorrect data
4. Moderators review and adjust if warranted
5. All disputes are logged for audit

## Common Questions

### What if I have multiple projects?

Each project is tracked separately. Your overall accountability score is an aggregate across all projects.

### What if my project is delayed?

Delays happen. What matters is:
1. Communicate proactively
2. Submit reports explaining blockers
3. Provide updated timelines
4. Don't disappear

### Can I remove a negative review?

No. Reviews cannot be removed by project owners. You can:
- Respond to the review with your perspective
- Report if it violates guidelines (false claims, harassment)
- Moderators can remove policy-violating content

### What if someone else claims my project?

Fraudulent claims are reviewed by moderators. Provide evidence of your ownership (wallet signature, email, etc.) and the fraudulent claim will be rejected.
